| An example PowerShell script you can use to remove a user profile on a Windows client. |

- Note that in the above lines in deleteuser.ps1 you need to replace <username> with the actual username of the profile you want to remove.

A word of warning: 
make sure you remove the correct user profile, as deleting a profile and associated registry entries is permanent and cannot be undone. Therefore, only use this script if you are sure that you want to remove the correct profile.
